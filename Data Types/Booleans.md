//It is a data type that can store only two values, true or false
//It is used to represent logical conditions or binary state in a program
//Internally true is represented as 1, while false is 0
//boolean values can be used in arithmetic operations
//Integer or floating-points values can be implicitly converted to bool(0 becomes false, non-zero values are true)

//NOTE
//1: Bool type variables or values true or false can be used in mathematical expressions
//int x = false + true + 10(false has a value of 0 while true has a value of 1)

//2:Data type integers or floating point values can be converted implicitly to bool type
bool x = 0; //false
bool y = 100; //true
bool z = 15.75; //true

//3; The most common use of bool data type is for conditional statements

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int a = 10, b =20;
int main(){
    //boolean variables
    const bool isEqual = (a == b);
    const bool isSmaller = (a < b);

    cout << "Is a = b? " << isEqual <<endl;
    cout << "Is a < b? " << isSmaller << endl;

    //boolean in if statement
    if (isSmaller)
        cout << "a is smaller than b" << endl;
        else
        cout << "a is larger than b" << endl;
   return 0;
