-In C++ enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of a set of
named integer constants

//Create an enum
-An enum keyword needs to be defined before its variables can be created
enum name{
   name1, name2, name3, //names for the constants which are unique identifiers
}

By default the first name in the enum is assigned an integer value 0 and subsequent ones
incremented by 1
A variable of the enum is created and assigned some name constant
enum_name var;

CHANGE THE VALUES OF NAMED CONSTANTS
enum enum_name {
   name1 = val1, name2 = val2,
};

//values should be an integer

*Enum classes in C++ provide better type safety and provides scope to constant names
It also requires manual typecasting to integer values from name
