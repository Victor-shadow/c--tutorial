-An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory
locations
-Multiple values should be stored under a single variable name and accessed using index
* All elements in the array must be of the same data type
* Array indexing starts from 0, enabling fast and direct access to elements

* DECLARATION OF AN ARRAY
- One can create or declare an array by specifying the data type first then the name of the array
data_type array_name[size] = {element1, element2, element3, element4};
-An array will be created with its name and store size elements of a given data type
Its size cannot be changed
-When an array is declared, the elements of an array do not contain any value

* An array is initialized by assigning initial values to array elements enclosed in '{}'
int arr[10] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500};
* values are assigned sequentially
The number of values in the list cannot be more than the size of the array

NOTE* int arr[10] = {0}; \\ the method only works for zero

* Arrays declared with more than one dimension are referred to as Multi-dimensional arrays
(An array size increases exponentially in one direction)

Syntax:
data_type array_name[size1][size2]
//size1 and size2 are the dimension sizes

*Size of an array refers to the number of elements that can be stored in an array
using the sizeof() operator

*PROPERTIES OF AN ARRAY
1: An array is a collection of data of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations
2: Indexing of an array starts from 0,
3: Elements in an array are accessed by an index
4: Once an array is declared its size remains constant throughout the program
5: An array can have multiple dimensions
6: The size of an array in bytes can be determined by the sizeof() operator which is useful in finding
the number of elements in an array
7: The size of the type of elements stored in an array is determined by subtraction of adjacent addresses
