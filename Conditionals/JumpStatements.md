//They are used to manipulate the flow of the program if some conditions are
//met
//It is used to terminate and continue the loop inside a program or to stop the execution
//of a function

//CONTINUE STATEMENT
//The C++ Continue statement is used to execute other parts of a loop while skipping some parts
//declared inside a condition, rather than terminating the loop
//It continues to execute the next iteration of the same loop
//It is used with a decision making statement which is mostly present in the loop

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
        if(i == 5) continue;
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

//BREAK STATEMENT
//It is used to terminate the whole loop if the condition is met
//Used with decision-making statements such as if-else, if, switch statement to break out of the block

//It forces the loop to stop execution of further iteration
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    //Loop to print digits from 1 - 4
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++){
        //Break condition
        if (i == 5)
            break;
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;

}

//RETURN STATEMENT
//The return statement takes control out of the function itself. It is stronger than a break
//It terminates the entire function after execution or after the same condition
//Every function has a return statement with some return value except the void() function


//GOTO STATEMENT
//The C++ goto statement is used to jump directly  to that part of the program to which it is being called
//Every goto statement is associated with a label which takes them to that part of the program for which they are
//called
//Label statements can be written anywhere in the program
