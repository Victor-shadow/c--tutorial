-A class is a template to create objects that have similar properties and
behaviour
- It is therefore a blueprint to create objects
-An Object is an instance of a class

C++ Classes
-A class is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and
member functions that can be accessed and used by creation of an instance of that class
- C++ classes are blueprints for creation of objects
-A class must be defined before its use using the class keyword

CLASS DEFINITION/TEMPLATE
class className{
    public: //Access Modifier
    //Data members/attributes
    DataType variableName;
    //member functions
    ReturnType functionName(){
     //logic
    }
}

int main(){
  //Create an Object
  ClassName objectName;
  //Access Data members
  objectName.variableName = value
  //invoke a member function
  objectName.functionName();
  return 0;

}
- The member function is defined inside the class, but they can also be just declared
in the class and then defined outside using scope resolution operator(::)

C++ Objects
-When a class is defined, only the attributes(variables) and behaviour(methods) for the object
are defined. No memory is allocated for the class definition
To use the data and access the functions defined in the class, objects need to be created
Objects are the actual entities that are created as an instance of a class

Create Object: Once the class is defined, objects can be created in the same way as variables are declared
of any inbuilt data types
An object is created by declaring the class name followed by the object name
*className objectName

Members of the class can be accessed inside the class itself by use of assigned name
*To access them outside use the dot operator with the object of the class
*Class members are accessed through the object using object.member for variables
and object.member() for functions

LOCAL CLASS
-Classes are generally declared in the global scope and are accessible to every function or other classes once
they are defined
- A class defined within a function is a local class and it is only accessible within that function

NESTED CLASS
-A class defined within another enclosing class. As a member of the enclosing class, it has the same access rights as any
members
The members of the enclosing class do not have special access to the members of the nested
class

ENUM CLASS
Enum classes in C++ are a safer and more organized way of using enums. They group related
constants together while avoiding name problems and ensure better type safety

CLASSES                                                    OBJECTS
1: A blueprint or template                                 An instance of a class with actual
for creation of objects                                    values

2: No memory is allocated for a                            Memory is allocated when an object is
class until an object is created                           created

3: They describe structure and                             They are real-entities created from a class
behaviour

4: Defines properties and functions common                 Stores specific data and manipulates it using
to all objects of that type                                class functions
